# SQL-Capstone-Projectnames
#Data Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing baby name data using SQL. It provides a collection of SQL queries designed to extract meaningful insights such as popular names over time, gender-based trends, and regional patterns. Ideal for analysts, data enthusiasts, or developers working with public datasets like the U.S. Social Security baby names data.

#Key Insights
**Top names**:Top names like "Michael", "Christopher" dominate the top spots for male baby names. While "Jessica" and "Ashley" dominate the top spots for female baby 
**Name Selection **The top 10 popular names had 8 boy names out of 967257 male names and 2 baby girl names out of 1245104 female names. This shows that boy name selection is more concerntrated on specific names while girl name selection is varied.
**States names variation**: States with lots of name variation include; CA 178427,TX  136850, NY  119020, FL  92823, IL  88340
**Gender Split**:Data shows that every year more female baby names are choosen than male names. This does not mean that more female babies are born based on the fact that boy names have more concerntrated selection as explained earlier.
